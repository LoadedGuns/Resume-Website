The HTML form you provided includes the attribute netlify in the form tag. This attribute suggests that the form is intended to be processed by Netlify Forms, which is a feature provided by the Netlify platform for handling form submissions on static websites.

When you submit the form, Netlify will automatically collect the form data and manage form submissions for you. However, to configure the form to be properly processed by Netlify Forms, you need to set up your Netlify account and configure form settings in your Netlify dashboard.

Here's what you need to do:

Set up a Netlify Account: If you haven't already, sign up for a Netlify account at https://www.netlify.com/.

Deploy Your Website to Netlify: Deploy your website to Netlify if you haven't already. Netlify provides various deployment options, including drag-and-drop, Git integration, and CLI deployment.

Configure Netlify Forms: Once your website is deployed to Netlify, go to your Netlify dashboard and navigate to the Forms section. You should see your form listed there. You can configure settings such as notifications, form handling, and spam protection from the Forms section.

Test Your Form: After configuring form settings, test your form to ensure that submissions are being processed correctly. You can submit the form on your website and check the form submissions in your Netlify dashboard.

If you've properly configured your Netlify account and form settings, form submissions should be handled automatically by Netlify, and you should be able to view and manage form submissions in your Netlify dashboard.
